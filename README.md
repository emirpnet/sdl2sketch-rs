# SDL2Sketch
SDL2Sketch tries to simplify the use of rust-sdl2 inspired by the API of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

The library is mostly still work in progress. You can run the examples to see what already works and what not:
```shell
cargo run --release --example demo
cargo run --release --example barnsleyfern
cargo run --release --example gameoflife
```
