# SDL2Sketch
SDL2Sketch tries to simplify the use of rust-sdl2 following the style of the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) API. It does not try to be a complete game engine, but just wants to make it as easy as possible to create visual applications with Rust without much boilerplate code.

## Getting started
The library is mostly still work in progress. You can run the examples to see what already works and what not:
```shell
cargo run --release --example demo
cargo run --release --example barnsleyfern
cargo run --release --example gameoflife
```

## Documentation
The documentation of the API can be build by ```cargo doc``` or be found [here](https://emirpnet.github.io/rustdoc/sdl2sketch/).
